> # **Description**
> **go-algebra** is a algebraic driven project to bring a solution to multi-service, equation relevant data handlers.
>
> The project aims to be of simple usage, and avoid language coupling the solutions.
>
> For this, a Abstract Syntax Tree (**[AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)**) was introduced as core of algebraic expressions, as well as output json structures.
>
> For large scale jobs that process data, execute numeric methods, create equations, and expect to persist the result somewhere for another service to consume, this is the ideal way to reach your objective.
> 
> <br>

<br>

> # **Technologies Used**
> > ## **Golang**
> > Pure standard golang library as possible.
> 
> <br>

<br>

> # **Architectural Decisions**
> > ## **High User Abstraction**
> > Whoever consumes **go-algebra** should not be worried about the mathematical and algebraic complexities.
> >
> > **go-algebra** aims to open as little as possible of how equations works at low level, so the developer can actually focus on its business rules.
> > 
> > Simplicity is the core of this project.
>
> > ## **Performance vs Legibility**
> > Even though performance is often given away for legibility and organization, **go-algebra** have layers of legibility, where the trade-off is meaningful.
> >
> > * For user accessible methods, the performance is given away for maximum legibility since its the least impactful part of the library.
> > * For execution level, the legibility and language is more low-level driven, since is assumed that someone changing this code should actually know both, math and low-level programming, deeply.
> > * **go-algebra** do have a internal cache for pre-computed operations that works bitwise for maximum performance. Even low-level developers may have a hard time reading it.
>
> > ## **Abstract Syntax Tree**
> > **go-algebra** uses the concept of Abstract Syntax Tree (**[AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)**) in a recursive object to simplify presentation as well as execution.
> >
> > In golang environment, this decision drastically simplify communication with other services, since a strict non-ambiguous pattern have been applied. More explained at **[Multi-Service Communication](#multi-service-communication)** topic.
>
> > ## **Angular Units: Why Radians?**
> > Any trigonometric operation will work expecting its value as radian (rad). Its the formal algebraic/calculus unit since it is purely mathematical measurements over a circle.
> > 
> > Its cleaner, more reliable, and universal if compared to degree (°).
> > 
> > Keep this in mind if you're creating a constant to define an angle, don't forget conversion if you using degree (°) unit for legibility in your system:
> > * `radians = degrees * pi / 180`
>

> # **Multi-Service Communication**
> ## **Json**
> > As explained at **[Abstract Syntax Tree](#abstract-syntax-tree)** sub-topic, the internal structure of Expressions is an **[AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)**, and its main advantage is a easy way to communicate equations around.
> > 
> > The Expression recursive behavior have a strict pattern already wrapped in json keys, so for a golang-golang service communication the `json.Marshal()` and `json.Unmarshal()` actually solves everything.
> > 
> > Any other language would have its own way to deal with json parsing, but the concept remains the same, language-free json structure.
> >
> > Following is a example of the json output:
> > ```json
> > {
> >     "type": "add",
> >     "args": [
> >         {
> >             "type": "integer",

> > Equation differs so you can declare its signature. Other than that, is just a wrapper for Expression.
> >
> > It were decided to avoid usage of `/` and `√` symbols to prevent complex nested parenthesis handling, since it was becoming unnecessarily complex and heavy to process. You can observe it in the above example, `sin(1/x)` is rather presented as `sin(x^(-1))`.

> > So, as a reminder:
> > * Power nodes of negatives means inverse, and multiplication by a expression in this condition means division by.
> > * Power nodes of non-integer values mean root. A non-integer negative is a inverse of a root.

> > ## **Least Squares Component**
> > > ### **Constructor Methods**
> > > * **`algebra_numeric_method.NewLeastSquares`**
> > >     - Creates a brand new `LeastSquares` object.
> > >     - Receives a `string` as parameter, it will copy it in any equation it produces as the signature.
> > > * **`.BaseOn`**
> > >   - Defines the basis functions for the least squares operation using the structure of the provided equation.
> > >   - Since least squares works by adjusting the coefficients of given terms (see **[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares)**), `Expression` type determines how the basis is extracted:
> > >       - `Sum` **(Recommended)**: The primary type for multi-term regression. The library treats every immediate child of the `Sum` as an independent basis function.
> > >       - `Float`/`Integer`: Interpreted as a single constant term.
> > >       - All Other Types: The entire expression is treated as a single basis function with one coefficient to be adjusted.
> > 
> > > ### **Action Methods**
> > > * **`.Solve`**
> > >   - Solves the least squares problem for the given `Frame` of points and returns a new `Equation` object.
> > >   - The returned `Equation` object follows the structure defined in `LeastSquare.Base`, but with all coefficients calculated to minimize the sum of squared residuals.
> > >   - This method does not modify the existing `LeastSquares` instance, and is memory safe for the brand new `Equation` object returned.
> 
> > ## **Frame Component**
> > > ### **Constructor Methods**
> > > * **`.AddPoint`**
> > >   - Add a cartesian point into the frame.
> > 
> > > ### **Action Methods**
> > > * **`.Sort`**
> > >   - Sorts the data within the `Frame` according to the specified sorting strategy.
> > > * **`.String`**
> > >   - Returns a human-readable representation of the `Frame`.
> > >   - Implements the `fmt.Stringer` interface for seamless integration with print functions.
> > > * **`.CSV`**
> > >   - Serializes the `Frame` into a text format optimized for spreadsheet compatibility.
> > >   - If `Frame.Name` is populated, the first line of the output will be the name followed by a newline.
> > >   - The data is always preceded by the fixed header line: `x;y`.
> > >   - Uses a semicolon (`;`) as delimiter to separate the x and y coordinates of each point.

> # **KNOWN ISSUES**
> > ## **Expression Component**
> > > With exception of `.Solve()` method, it is well known that the library doesn't handle well multiple equal `Symbol` leafs, specially at `.Equal()` callings.
> > >
> > > We expect to solve this once a `.Simplify()` method is introduced, and its helpers be able to temporarily simplify redundant, or even unnecessary, expression branches/leafs.
> >
> > > `.Solve()` method will not care for true symbology, any variable will be treated as "x" variable at a 2d equation behavior.
> > >
> > > We expect to solve this in the future introducing an object as argument for `.Solve()` linking a value to a symbol, but special attention should be given for simplicity be kept.
> > 
> > > The trigonometric functions only support `Sine`, `Cosine` and `Tangent`. 
> > > 
> > > `Cosecant`, `Secant` and `Cotangent` can be achieved by:
> > > ```golang
> > > // Cosecant
> > > Pow(
> > >   Sin(
> > >     Symbol("x"),

> > >
> > > That said, `Arcsine`, `Arccosine`, `Arctangent` and their counterparts `Arccosecant`, `Arcsecant` and `Arccotangent` will be introduced further in the future.
